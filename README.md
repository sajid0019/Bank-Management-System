<h1>Bank Management System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The Bank Management System is a comprehensive software application designed to manage and automate various banking operations. The system utilizes a relational database management system (RDBMS) built using SQL to store and manage customer data, account information, transactions, and other relevant banking details. The application is developed using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language.</p>

<h2>System Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer Management:</strong> Create, update, and delete customer accounts, including personal and contact information.</li>
  <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Manage various types of bank accounts, such as savings, checking, and loan accounts.</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction Management:</strong> Record and manage various transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and payments.</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting and Analytics:</strong> Generate reports on customer accounts, transactions, and other banking activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Security and Authentication:</strong> Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> Design and implement a relational database using SQL to store banking data.</li>
  <li><strong>Python Application:</strong> Develop a Python application to interact with the database and provide a user-friendly interface for banking operations.</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Create a simple and intuitive user interface using a Python library such as Tkinter or PyQt.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To design and implement a comprehensive bank management system using SQL and Python.</li>
  <li>To provide a secure and user-friendly interface for banking operations.</li>
  <li>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in managing banking data and transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project aims to provide a practical solution for managing banking operations while demonstrating the capabilities of SQL and Python in building a robust and efficient software application.</p>
